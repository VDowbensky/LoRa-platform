//Layer 0: LoRa Radio
//All data is converted into LoRa symbols which are sent to the radio for transmission. The details are described elsewhere, but it is worth noting that 
//in addition to the converted packet bytes described below, there is also a preamble sent at the start of any data packet. 
//This preamble allows receiving radios to synchronize clocks and start framing. We use a preamble length of 16, which is longer than the minimum preamble length of 8,
//to let SX126x LoRa receivers sleep for a while, which lowers power consumption.
//After the preamble comes the LoRa Physical Header, which contains information about the packet length as well as a sync word to distinguish networks. 
//For Meshtastic, it is set to 0x2B.
